# ðŸ“„ Project Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the software requirements for the LLM-Powered Data Formatting and Analysis System. The application is designed to process unstructured or semi-structured textual data (e.g., logs, notes) and convert it into structured, meaningful output using Large Language Models (LLMs) via the OpenAI API.

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 API Service
- The system shall expose a RESTful API endpoint (`/transform/`) to receive input data via POST request.
- The API shall support both raw text (JSON) and file uploads (e.g., `.txt`).
- The API shall return a structured response containing:
  - A cleaned or summarized version of the text
  - Extracted metadata or keywords (optional)
  - Any relevant insights inferred from the content

### 2.2 Data Processing
- The system shall use OpenAI's GPT model via API for text processing.
- The processing logic shall reside in a modular Python function (`processor.py`).
- The system shall validate input data before processing.

### 2.3 Error Handling
- The system shall handle malformed inputs with clear error responses.
- If the OpenAI API fails or is unavailable, the user shall receive a `503 Service Unavailable` message.

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- Average API response time should be under 3 seconds for files â‰¤ 1KB.

### 3.2 Scalability
- The system should be deployable as a Docker container, enabling horizontal scaling in Kubernetes or similar platforms.

### 3.3 Security
- API key for OpenAI must be secured via environment variables (never hardcoded).
- No user data will be stored; the system is stateless by design.

### 3.4 Usability
- The system shall expose Swagger/OpenAPI documentation at `/docs`.

## 4. Software Environment

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.11
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **External APIs**: OpenAI GPT (via HTTPS REST API)
- **Runtime Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt`

---

## 5. Assumptions and Constraints

- The user must provide a valid OpenAI API key.
- The system assumes text input is in English (multilingual support may be considered in future).
- The system requires internet access to contact the OpenAI API.

---

## 6. Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Authentication with API keys or OAuth2
- Support for batch processing of files
