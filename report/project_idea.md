# 💡 Project Idea: LLM-Powered Data Formatting and Analysis System

This project aims to develop a lightweight, containerized data processing application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently transform and analyze unstructured data such as logs or free-form text.

## 🔍 Core Idea

The system provides an API endpoint where users can submit raw data (e.g., from `example.txt`) and receive back a structured summary or analysis. Internally, the system uses OpenAI's LLM capabilities to:
- Convert log or textual data into readable summaries
- Extract key insights and patterns
- Reformat the content into structured formats (e.g., JSON)

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

- **FastAPI** for serving HTTP endpoints
- **Docker** for containerization
- **OpenAI API** for LLM-based transformation
- **Modular Python code** under `app/` for processing logic

## 🧑‍💻 Use Cases

- Developers debugging log files
- Analysts parsing system events
- Applications that need natural language enrichment of structured data

## 🎯 Goal

To offer a plug-and-play, cloud-ready microservice that can be integrated into broader data pipelines or dev tools for intelligent data formatting and transformation using LLMs.
